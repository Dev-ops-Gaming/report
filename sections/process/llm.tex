We utilized two large language models (LLMs) throughout the project to support our development process: GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. GitHub Copilot was primarily used for code completion and was constantly active during development. ChatGPT, on the other hand, was used to quickly gain an overview of how to attack an issue, e.g., a database index issue, which is described in section \ref{operation}, or conveying the essential documentation for e.g., our web framework "Gorilla".

We found that the LLMs significantly improved our workflow by accelerating learning and implementation. However, we suspect Copilot of introducing the API issue also described in \ref{operation}, so it is important to be critical when utilizing these tools.
