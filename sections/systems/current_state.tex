We have implemented the two tools Sonarqube and Code Climate, which can assist in estimating the maintainability and technical debt of our project.
\subsubsection{Code Climate}
Code Climate reports 10 code smells, 0 duplications and 0 other issues. This leaves us with an A-rank (see figure \ref{fig:CodeClimate})\\

\subsubsection{Sonarqube}
Sonarqube reports 18 issues - all in the category 'maintainability' - and 0.9\% code duplication (see figure \ref{fig:SonarQube}). A majority of these issues are found in the tests, and many of the issues are in regards to string duplicates.
