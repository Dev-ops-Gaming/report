\section{Reflection Perspective}
\subsection{Evolution and Refactoring}
Evolution (im guessing this means the general evolution of the project as it was expanded over time?): We did not spend time identifying bottlenecks, be it technical or in regards to work ethic. When problems about developing the system arose, we would only dedicate a bit extra effort to solve them, while a lot of effort was spent on new tasks. So we often had tasks which where left unfinished for weeks.\\


Refactoring: We didnt 'properly' do it - we didn't specifically dedicate time to it. Rather a few of the group members would at random do a refactor of some of the code. The only 'planned' refactoring happened near the end, where we refactored the code Sonarqube and Code climate bitched abt.\\
Lessons learned here are fx that you should DEDICATE time to refactoring - people usually dont 'just' do refactoring, it must be set as a task, and one should expect to spend a good amount of time on it. Refactoring takes time!\\

\subsection{Operation}

\subsection{Maintenance}
While one can do a lot of testing and peer reviews before deploying code, there's always the chance a bug was overlooked. So how do we catch such a bug? We did not have a properly defined 'plan' to follow, with instructions on when and where to check the system. The bugs/problems we found were often found at random, but could potentially have been caught earlier, if we made sure to check for such things regularly through fx monitoring. Some members checked the monitoring sometimes, but it felt more random than planned.
