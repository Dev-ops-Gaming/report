\section{Current state of our MiniTwit}
We have implemented the two tools Sonarqube and Code Climate, which can estimate the maintainability and techincal debt of our project.\\
\subsection{Code Climate}
Code Climate reports 10 code smells, 0 duplications and 0 other issues. This leaves us with an A-rank.[insert pics]\\

\subsection{Sonarqube}
Sonarqube reports 18 issues - all in the category 'maintainability' - and 0.9\% code duplication. A majority of these issues are found in the tests, and many of the issues are in regards to string duplicates.\\
